Revision history for TkUtil-Configure

0.01    Mar 4, 2009
        First release
0.02    Corrected minor spelling typos and documented a function
        that was making people say it was failing tests.
0.03    Automatic testers are apparently running with no ability
        to connect with X display, so I made test.pl exit cleanly
        if it cannot open display.
